# Twitch Vid Converter
Convert filenames of Twitch clips and highlites to use the title.

To use this simple app:
- Download the zip file from the "Release" folder.
- Extract the executable.
- Drag the executable to the directory that contains your mp4 files that are downloaded clips and highlights from Twitch.
- Run the executable.
- It will automatically convert the file names all mp4s that are from Twitch to use the video title.

*Note: If Windows quarentines the zip right away and claims it is a virus, you can get around this by downloading the whole repository as a zip, then getting the zip file from the downloaded repository.
